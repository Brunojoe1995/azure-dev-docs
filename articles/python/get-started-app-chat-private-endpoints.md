# CustomerIntent: As a python developer new to Azure, I want to deploy a chat app with private access so that I understand how to secure my chat app endpoint.

# Get started with chat private endpoints for Python

This article shows you how to deploy and run the [Enterprise chat app sample for Python](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) accessible by private endpoints. Use a Bastion RDP from the Azure portal to access the virtual machine. Use a web browser on the virtual machine to access the chat app.

This sample implements a chat app using Python, Azure OpenAI Service, and [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview) in Azure AI Search to get answers about employee benefits at a fictitious company. The app is seeded with PDF files including the employee handbook, a benefits document and a list of company roles and expectations.

By following the instructions in this article, you will:

- Deploy a chat app to Azure for public access in a web browser.
- Configure private endpoints.
- Redeploy chat app with private endpoints.
- Access chat app through a VM with Bastion.

Once you complete this procedure, you can start modifying the new project with your custom code and redeploy, knowing your chat app is accessible only through the private VM with a private endpoint.

## Architectural overview

The default deployment creates a chat app with public endpoints. For chat apps enriched with private data, you should secure access to your chat app. This article shows one solution: use a virtual private network (VPN).

The VPN has four subnets:

- App integration: the App Service which hosts the chat app
- VM: the virtual machine used to access the chat app in a browser
- Azure Bastion: used to connect from the VM to the App integration subnet
- Backend: all the services which help the chat app delivery chat answers.

Configure the deployment to use the VPN with the setting of

## Prerequisites

A [development container](https://containers.dev/) environment is available with all dependencies required to complete this article. You can run the development container in GitHub Codespaces (in a browser) or locally using Visual Studio Code.

To use this article, you need the following prerequisites:

#### [Codespaces (recommended)](#tab/github-codespaces)

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services?azure-portal=true) 

- Azure account permissions - Your Azure Account must have Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write permissions, such as [User Access Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner).

- Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription.
    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at [https://aka.ms/oai/access](https://aka.ms/oai/access). Open an issue on this repo to contact us if you have an issue.

- GitHub account

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

- An Azure subscription - [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/ai-services?azure-portal=true)

- Azure account permissions - Your Azure Account must have Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write permissions, such as [User Access Administrator](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner).

- [Azure Developer CLI](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli)

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - start Docker Desktop if it's not already running

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- [Dev Container Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

## Open development environment

Begin now with a development environment that has all the dependencies installed to complete this article.

#### [GitHub Codespaces (recommended)](#tab/github-codespaces)

[GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/codespaces) runs a development container managed by GitHub with [Visual Studio Code for the Web](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/vscode-web) as the user interface. For the most straightforward development environment, use GitHub Codespaces so that you have the correct developer tools and dependencies preinstalled to complete this article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All GitHub accounts can use Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with 2 core instances. For more information, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

1. Start the process to create a new GitHub Codespace on the `main` branch of the [`Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo) GitHub repository.
1. Right-click on the following button, and select _Open link in new windows_ in order to have both the development environment and the documentation available at the same time.

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/azure-search-openai-demo)

1. On the **Create codespace** page, review the codespace configuration settings and then select **Create new codespace**

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-template/github-create-codespace.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the confirmation screen before creating a new codespace.":::

1. Wait for the codespace to start. This startup process can take a few minutes.

1. In the terminal at the bottom of the screen, sign in to Azure with the Azure Developer CLI.

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```

1. Copy the code from the terminal and then paste it into a browser. Follow the instructions to authenticate with your Azure account.

1. The remaining tasks in this article take place in the context of this development container.

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

The [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for Visual Studio Code requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) to be installed on your local machine. The extension hosts the development container locally using the Docker host with the correct developer tools and dependencies preinstalled to complete this article.

1. Create a new local directory on your computer for the project.

    ```bash
    mkdir my-intelligent-app && cd my-intelligent-app
    ```

1. Open Visual Studio Code in that directory:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio Code.
1. Run the following AZD command to bring the GitHub repository to your local computer.

    ```bash
    azd init -t azure-search-openai-demo
    ```

1. Open the Command Palette, search for and select **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container** to open the project in a dev container. Wait until the dev container opens before continuing.
1. Sign in to Azure with the Azure Developer CLI.

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```

    Copy the code from the terminal and then paste it into a browser. Follow the instructions to authenticate with your Azure account.

1. The remaining exercises in this project take place in the context of this development container.
