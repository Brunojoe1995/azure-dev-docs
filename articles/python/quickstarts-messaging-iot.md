# Messaging, Events, and IoT for Python apps on Azure

The following articles help you get started with messaging, event ingestion and processing, and Internet of Things (IoT) services in Azure.

## Messaging

Messaging services on Azure provide the interconnectivity between components and applications that are written in different languages and hosted in the same cloud, multiple clouds, or on-premises.

## Internet of Things (IoT)

Internet of Things or IoT refers to a collection of managed and platform services across edge and cloud that connect, monitor, and control IoT assets. IoT also includes security and operating systems for devices and data and analytics that help you build, deploy, and manage IoT applications.
