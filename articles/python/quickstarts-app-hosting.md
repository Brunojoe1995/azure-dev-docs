# Hosting Python apps on Azure

Azure provides various different ways to host your app depending on your needs. The article [Hosting applications on Azure](../intro/hosting-apps-on-azure.md) provides an overview of the different options.

Generally speaking, choosing an Azure hosting option is a matter of choosing on the continuum of control versus responsibility. The more control you need, the more responsibility you take on for management of the resource(s). In this continuum, we recommend starting with Azure App Service, with the least administrative responsibility on your part. Then, consider other options in the continuum moving toward taking more administrative responsibility of your Azure resources. At the other end of the continuum from App Service is Azure Virtual Machines, where you have the most control and more administrative responsibility for maintaining your resources.

The sections in this article are arranged approximately from more managed options (less management overhead for you) to less managed options (more control for you).
