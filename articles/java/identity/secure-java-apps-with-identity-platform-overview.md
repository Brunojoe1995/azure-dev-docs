# Tutorial: Get started with securing java application with Microsoft Identity platform

This article provides an overview of recommended strategies for securing Java applications with Microsoft Identity Platform.


## Get Started 

The [Microsoft identity platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/v2-overview), along with [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/whatis) (Entra ID) and [Azure Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview) (Azure AD B2C) are central to the **Azure** cloud ecosystem. This tutorial aims to take you through the fundamentals of modern authentication using the [Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Java](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-java)

## Next steps

We recommend following the chapters in successive order. However, the code samples are self-contained, so feel free to pick samples by topics that you may need at the moment.
