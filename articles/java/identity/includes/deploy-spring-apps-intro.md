You use the [Maven Plugin for Azure Spring Apps](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-maven-plugins/wiki/Azure-Spring-Apps) to deploy a Java Spring Boot application to an app on [Azure Spring Apps](/azure/spring-apps/). Azure Spring Apps is a managed service for hosting Spring apps.

If Maven isn't your preferred development tool, check out our similar tutorials for Java developers:

- [IntelliJ IDEA](/azure/spring-apps/enterprise/how-to-intellij-deploy-apps)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-spring-apps)

For deployment, you need:

- An Azure subscription.
- If you're deploying an Azure Spring Apps Enterprise plan instance for the first time in the target subscription, see the Requirements section of Enterprise plan in Azure Marketplace.
