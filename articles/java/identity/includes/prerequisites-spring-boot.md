## Prerequisites

- [JDK Version 15](https://jdk.java.net/15/). This sample has been developed on a system with Java 15 but may be compatible with other versions.
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [Java Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack) is recommended for running this sample in VSCode.
- An **Microsoft Entra ID** tenant. For more information see: [How to get an Microsoft Entra ID tenant](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Microsoft Entra ID** tenant. This sample doesn't work with a personal Microsoft account. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [VS Code Azure Tools Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack)
