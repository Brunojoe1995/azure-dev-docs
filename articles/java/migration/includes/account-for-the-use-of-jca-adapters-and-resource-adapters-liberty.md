### Account for the use of JCA adapters and resource adapters

If your existing application uses JCA adapters or resource adapters to connect to other enterprise systems, ensure that you apply the configuration for these artifacts to the Liberty server running on AKS. For more information, see [Overview of JCA configuration elements](https://www.ibm.com/docs/was-liberty/base?topic=resourceadapter-overview-jca-configuration-elements) and [Java Connector Architecture](https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/jca-1.7.html).
