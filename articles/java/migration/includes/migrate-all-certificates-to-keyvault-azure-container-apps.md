### Migrate all certificates to KeyVault

Azure Containers Apps supports secure communication between apps. Your application doesn't need to manage the process of establishing secure communication. You can upload the private certificate to Azure Container Apps or use a free managed certificate provided by Azure Container Apps. Using Azure Key Vault to manage certificates is a recommended approach. For more information, see [Certificates in Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/certificates-overview).
