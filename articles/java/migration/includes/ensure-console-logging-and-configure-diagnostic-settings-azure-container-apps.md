### Ensure console logging and configure diagnostic settings

Configure your logging to ensure that all output is routed to the console rather than to files.

Once an application is deployed to Azure Container Apps, you can configure the logging options within your Container Apps environment to define one or more destinations of the logs. These destinations can include Azure Monitor Log Analytics, Azure Event hub, or even other third-party monitoring solutions. Additionally, you have the option to disable log data and view logs only at runtime. For detailed configuration instruction, see [Log storage and monitoring options in Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/log-options).
