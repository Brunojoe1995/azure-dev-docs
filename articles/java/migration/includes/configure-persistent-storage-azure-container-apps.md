### Configure persistent storage

If any part of your application reads or writes to the local file system, you need to configure persistent storage to replace the local file system. You can specify the path to mount in the container through the app settings and align it with the path your app is using. For more information, see [Use storage mounts in Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps/storage-mounts).
