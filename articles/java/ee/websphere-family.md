# What are solutions to run the WebSphere family of products on Azure?

This article describes the solutions for running the IBM WebSphere family of products on Azure. These solutions are jointly developed and supported by IBM and Microsoft.

The IBM WebSphere product portfolio is a set of industry-leading runtimes powering some of the most mission-critical enterprise applications across geographies and environments. The WebSphere portfolio includes WebSphere (traditional) Application Server, WebSphere Liberty, and Open Liberty.

WebSphere products are key components in enabling enterprise Java workloads on Azure. The jointly developed solutions aim to cover a range of use cases from mission-critical existing traditional workloads to cloud-native applications. The solutions target Open Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO), WebSphere Liberty on ARO, Open Liberty on the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), WebSphere Liberty on AKS, and WebSphere Application Server on Virtual Machines. The solutions are aimed at making it as easy as possible to migrate your application to the cloud by automating most boilerplate Azure and Java resource provisioning and configuration tasks. Once initial provisioning is done, you're completely free to customize deployments further.

The currently available offers are linked at the bottom of this page.

If you want to provide feedback on these offers, stay-up-date on the roadmap, or work closely on your migration scenarios with the engineering team developing these offers, select **Contact Me** on the Azure Marketplace offer [overview page](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-aiops.2021-02-17_websphere_offerings_contact_me?tab=Overview). Program managers, architects, and engineers will reach out to you shortly to start collaboration. The opportunity to collaborate on a migration scenario is free while the offers are under active development.

You can open support issues on the jointly developed offers with either IBM or Microsoft. When appropriate, IBM and Microsoft will collaborate on their resolution. Beyond the offers, Microsoft provides support for Azure. IBM similarly provides support for WebSphere, WebSphere Liberty, and Open Liberty.

## Open Liberty and WebSphere Liberty on Azure Red Hat OpenShift

This offer automatically provisions several Azure resources to quickly move to WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on ARO. The automatically provisioned resources include an ARO cluster and the Liberty Operators. A secure OpenShift project is set up to contain your application. The offer can also deploy a sample application or a container image with your application. The offer is available as an [Azure solution template in the Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-aiops.20210823-liberty-aroliberty-aro). IBM and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step guidance on getting started with Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty and ARO. For more information, see [Deploy a Java application with Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty on an Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster](liberty-on-aro.md). This guidance is intended for customers that would prefer a native OpenShift manual deployment experience instead of automated provisioning using the solution template.

## Open Liberty and WebSphere Liberty on AKS

This offer automatically provisions several Azure resources to quickly move to WebSphere Liberty or Open Liberty on AKS. The automatically provisioned resources can include the Azure Container Registry (ACR), an AKS cluster, Azure App Gateway as an Ingress Controller (AGIC), and the Liberty Operators. The offer can also deploy a sample application or a container image with your application. The offer is available as an [Azure solution template in the Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#create/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-aiops.20210924-liberty-aksliberty-aks). IBM and Microsoft also provide basic step-by-step guidance on getting started with Open Liberty/WebSphere Liberty and AKS. For more information, see [Manually deploy a Java application with Open Liberty or WebSphere Liberty on an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster](howto-deploy-java-liberty-app-manual.md). This guidance is intended for customers that would prefer a native Kubernetes manual deployment experience instead of automated provisioning using the solution template.

## WebSphere Application Server on VMs

These offers automatically provision several Azure resources to quickly move to WebSphere (traditional) Application Server on Azure VMs. The automatically provisioned resources can include virtual network, storage, network security group, Java, Linux, WebSphere, and database connectivity (Db2, Oracle database, Azure SQL). There are two separate offers that target WebSphere Network Deployment (ND) clusters or a simple WebSphere (Base) instance. With minimal effort, you can provision a fully functional, highly available WebSphere ND cluster, including the Deployment Manager and any number of servers. You can also have the cluster offer provision IBM HTTP Server or Azure App Gateway as a load-balancer. The Deployment Manager and all servers are started by default, which allows you to begin managing the cluster right away using the Admin Console. Similarly, the single instance offer easily provisions a WebSphere (Base) server on a VM with the Console fully functional. Both the [cluster](https://portal.azure.com/#create/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-aiops.2021-04-08-twas-clustercluster) and [single instance](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/ibm-usa-ny-armonk-hq-6275750-ibmcloud-aiops.2022-01-07-twas-base-single-server2022-01-07-twas-base-single-server) offers are available as Azure solution templates in the Azure portal. IBM and Microsoft also provide basic VM images for WebSphere ND and Base. The VM images are suitable for customers that need very customized deployments.
