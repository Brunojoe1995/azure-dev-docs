## Install the Azure Functions Core Tools V3

To enable local debugging, you need to install the [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools), which can be done directly in Visual Studio Code.

1. With a bash terminal on your local computer. The location will be the root for your serverless project. Start Visual Studio Code:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. Open the **Command Palette** (**F1**), enter **Azure Functions: Install or Update Azure Functions Core Tools**, and press **Enter** to run the command.

1. To verify installation, select the menu command **Terminal** > **New Terminal** in VS Code, then run the command, `func`. The command should show output like that below (along with usage information).
