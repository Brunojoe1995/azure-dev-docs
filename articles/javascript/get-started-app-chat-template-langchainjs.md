# Get started with Serverless AI Chat with RAG using LangChain.js

Creating AI apps can be complex. With LangChain.js, Azure Functions, and Serverless technologies, you can simplify this process. These tools manage infrastructure and scale automatically, letting you focus on chatbot functionality. The chatbot uses enterprise documents to generate AI responses.

The code includes sample data for a fictitious company, Contoso Real Estate. Customers can ask support questions about the company's products. The data includes documents on the company's terms of service, privacy policy, and support guide.

## Architectural overview

### The chat app

The user interacts with the application:

- With the chat interface in the client web app.
- The client web app sends the user's query to the Serverless API via HTTP calls.
- The Serverless API creates a chain to coordinate interactions between Azure AI and Azure AI Search to generate an answer.
- If there's a need to reference the documents, Azure Blob Storage is used to retrieve the PDF documents.
- The generated response is then sent back to the web app and displayed to the user.

A simple architecture of the chat app is shown in the following diagram:

:::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-langchainjs/simple-architecture-diagram.png" alt-text="Diagram showing architecture from client to backend app.":::

### LangChainjs simplifies the complexity between services

The API flow is useful to understand how LangChainJS is helpful in this scenario by abstracting out the interactions. The **serverless API endpoint**:

- Receives the question from the user. 
- Creates client objects:
    - Azure OpenAI for embeddings and chat
    - Azure AI Search for the vector store
- Creates a document chain with the LLM model, the chat message (system and user prompts), and the document source.
- Creates a retrieval chain from the document chain and the vector store. 
- Streams the responses from the retrieval chain.

The developer's work is to correctly configure the dependencies services, such as Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search and construct the chains correctly. The underlying chain logic knows how to resolve the query. This allows you to construct chains from many different services and configurations as long as they work with the LangChain requirements. 

### Where is Azure in this architecture?

This application is made from multiple components:

- A web app made with a single chat web component built with [Lit](https://lit.dev) and hosted on [Azure Static Web Apps](/azure/static-web-apps). The code is located in the `packages/webapp` folder.

- A serverless API built with [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions) and using [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/) to ingest the documents and generate responses to the user chat queries. The code is located in the `packages/api` folder.

- An [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/) service to create embeddings and generate an answer.  

- A database to store the text extracted from the documents and the vectors generated by LangChain.js, using [Azure AI Search](/azure/search).

- A file storage to store the source documents, using [Azure Blob Storage](/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction).

For the most straightforward development environment, use GitHub Codespaces so that you have the correct developer tools and dependencies preinstalled to complete this article.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All GitHub accounts can use Codespaces for up to 60 hours free each month with 2 core instances. For more information, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).


1. Open in Codespace.

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/serverless-chat-langchainjs)


1. Wait for the codespace to start. This startup process can take a few minutes.

1. In the terminal at the bottom of the screen, sign in to Azure with the Azure Developer CLI.

    ```bash
    azd auth login
    ```

    Complete the authentication process.

1. The remaining tasks in this article take place in the context of this development container.

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

The [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for Visual Studio Code requires [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) to be installed on your local machine. The extension hosts the development container locally using the Docker host with the correct developer tools and dependencies preinstalled to complete this article.

1. Fork the sample repository with the following link: [Azure-Samples/serverless-chat-langchainjs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-chat-langchainjs/fork).

1. Clone your fork to your local computer. Replace `<GITHUB_USER>` with your GITHUB user name.

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/<GITHUB_USER>/serverless-chat-langchainjs
    ```

1. Open **Visual Studio Code** in the new directory.

    ```console
    cd serverless-chat-langchainjs && code .

## Deploy and run

The sample repository contains all the code and configuration files you need to deploy the serverless chat app to Azure. The following steps walk you through the process of deploying the sample to Azure.

### Deploy chat app to Azure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure resources created in this section incur immediate costs, primarily from the Azure AI Search resource. These resources may accrue costs even if you interrupt the command before it is fully executed. 

1. Run the following Azure Developer CLI command to provision the Azure resources and deploy the source code:

    ```bash
    azd up
    ```
1. Use the following table to answer the prompts:

    |Prompt|Answer|
    |--|--|
    |Environment name|Keep it short and lowercase. Add your name or alias. For example, `john-chat`. It's used as part of the resource group name.| 
    |Subscription|Select the subscription to create the resources in. |
    |Location (for hosting)|Select a location near you from the list.|
    |Location for the OpenAI model|Select a location near you from the list. If the same location is available as your first location, select that.|

1. Wait until app is deployed. It may take 5-10 minutes for the deployment to complete.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The documents are uploaded to the `/api/documents` route after the deployment is complete as a process after the `azd up` command. This post-up process is controlled by the `azure.yaml` file. 

1. After the application has been successfully deployed, you see two URLs displayed in the terminal. 
1. Select that URL labeled `Deploying service webapp` to open the chat application in a browser.

### Use chat app to get answers from PDF files

The chat app is preloaded with rental information from a [PDF file catalog](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-chat-langchainjs/tree/main/data). You can use the chat app to ask questions about the rental process. The following steps walk you through the process of using the chat app.

1. In the browser, select or enter **What is the refund policy**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-langchainjs/first-prompt-chat.png" lightbox="./media/get-started-app-chat-langchainjs/first-prompt-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chat app's first answer.":::

1. Select a follow-up question.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-langchainjs/follow-up-suggested-prompt.png" lightbox="./media/get-started-app-chat-langchainjs/follow-up-suggested-prompt.png" alt-text="Screenshot of chat app's suggested follow up prompt and answer":::

1. From the response, select the citation to see the document used to generate the answer. This delivers the document from Azure Storage to the client. When you're done with the new browser tab, close it to return to the serverless chat app.

## Clean up resources

### Clean up Azure resources

The Azure resources created in this article are billed to your Azure subscription. If you don't expect to need these resources in the future, delete them to avoid incurring more charges.

Run the following Azure Developer CLI command to delete the Azure resources and remove the source code:

```bash
azd down --purge
```

### Clean up GitHub Codespaces

#### [GitHub Codespaces](#tab/github-codespaces)

Deleting the GitHub Codespaces environment ensures that you can maximize the amount of free per-core hours entitlement you get for your account.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For more information about your GitHub account's entitlements, see [GitHub Codespaces monthly included storage and core hours](https://docs.github.com/billing/managing-billing-for-github-codespaces/about-billing-for-github-codespaces#monthly-included-storage-and-core-hours-for-personal-accounts).

1. Sign into the GitHub Codespaces dashboard (<https://github.com/codespaces>).

1. Locate your currently running Codespaces sourced from the [`Azure-Samples/serverless-chat-langchainjs`](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/serverless-chat-langchainjs) GitHub repository.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-langchainjs/github-codespace-dashboard.png" alt-text="Screenshot of all the running Codespaces including their status and templates.":::

1. Open the context menu, `...`, for the codespace and then select **Delete**.

#### [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

You aren't necessarily required to clean up your local environment, but you can stop the running development container and return to running Visual Studio Code in the context of a local workspace.

1. Open the **Command Palette**, search for the **Dev Containers** commands, and then select **Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/get-started-app-chat-langchainjs/reopen-local-command-palette.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Command Palette option to reopen the current folder within your local environment.":::

> [!TIP]
> Visual Studio Code will stop the running development container, but the container still exists in Docker in a stopped state. You always have the option to deleting the container instance, container image, and volumes from Docker to free up more space on your local machine.
