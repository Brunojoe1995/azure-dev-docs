# GraphQL Developer Guide on Azure

Understand how to use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) on Azure. 

* **Bring** GraphQL applications to the Azure web app hosting services such as Static Web Apps, App Service, and Azure Functions.
* **Build** GraphQL endpoints to your existing data sources without adding GraphQL infrastructure.

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

GraphQL [language support](https://graphql.org/code/) is extensive, allowing you to choose your language of choice to build GraphQL applications. GraphQL is also supported by many [client libraries](https://graphql.org/code/#graphql-clients) and [server libraries](https://graphql.org/code/#graphql-servers).

## Front-end client resources for GraphQL

GraphQL front-end clients connect to website to pass along GraphQL-formatted queries. Clients include front-end integrations from third-party libraries. This allows you to bring your own GraphQL client to the web. 

If you have a database already hosted on Azure, you can integrate GraphQL queries in your static web app, and enable GraphQL queries to connect to your database without having to build a GraphQL server.
