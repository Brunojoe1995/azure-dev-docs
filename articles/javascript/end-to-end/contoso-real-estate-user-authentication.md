# User authentication with Contoso Real Estate

The Contoso Real app has two front-end applications: blog and portal. The blob is publicly available, but the portal requires authentication to see Real Estate listings. 

## User authentication for portal users

To provide user authentication with social providers, the Contoso Real Estate app uses Azure Static Web Apps, which provides a built-in authentication mechanism. This allows you get up and running quickly with authentication without having to write any code for the authentication steps. 

## Configure user authentication for Static Web Apps

## Locally develop with Static Web Apps CLI

## Deploy Azure Static Web Apps with authentication

## Test authentication with Playwright
