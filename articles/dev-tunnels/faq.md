# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

This article answers some frequently asked questions about dev tunnels.

## What is dev tunnels?

Dev tunnels allow developers to securely share local web services across the internet. There are many use cases including: sharing in-progress work without having to deploy an application; prototyping applications locally that need the ability to receive webhook notifications from other services; working with local web services during mobile development.

## When are unused dev tunnels deleted?

## Is it better to recreate dev tunnels or reuse the same dev tunnel?

We'd recommend reusing the same dev tunnel when it's convenient, rather than creating a new one for every use. It's also slightly faster to get an existing dev tunnel compared to creating a new one. In addition, by reusing the same dev tunnel, the dev tunnel web forwarding URL can be stable instead of changing on every use.

## Can anonymous users create dev tunnels?

No, anonymous users can't create dev tunnels. All creation of dev tunnels requires either a Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), Microsoft, or GitHub account.

## What are the license terms for dev tunnels?
