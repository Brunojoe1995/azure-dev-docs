## Azure OpenAI Service

The Azure OpenAIprovides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, image understanding, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio.
