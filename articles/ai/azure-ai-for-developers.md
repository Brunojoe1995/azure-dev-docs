# Overview of AI app development

This documentation is designed for experienced developers who are new to building generative AI apps on Azure using Azure OpenAI Services and their favorite programming language.

## Introduction to generative AI for developers

Generative AI opens many new possibilities for applications. As a developer, it's important that you develop a mental model that maps how all the new terminology and technologies related to generative AI fit into what you already understand. The following series of articles show you how your current development experience applies to generative AI. 

* [Introduction to developing generative AI apps for experienced developers](./introduction-build-generative-ai-solutions.md)
* [Important concepts and considerations for developers building generative AI solutions](./gen-ai-concepts-considerations-developers.md)
* [Augmenting a Large Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Fine-tuning](./augment-llm-rag-fine-tuning.md)
* [Building advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems](./advanced-retrieval-augmented-generation.md)

## AI app templates

AI app templates provide you with well-maintained, easy to deploy reference samples that provide a high-quality starting point for your AI apps.

There are two categories of AI app templates, **building blocks** and **end-to-end solutions**. Building blocks are smaller-scale samples that focus on specific scenarios and tasks. End-to-end solutions are comprehensive reference samples including documention, source code, and deployment to allow you to take and extend for your own purposes.

To review a list of key templates available for each programming language, see [AI app templates](/azure/developer/ai/intelligent-app-templates). To browse all available templates, see the AI app templates on the [Azure Developer CLI gallery](https://aka.ms/ai-apps).

One of the most popular templates is the chat with your data sample using Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search.
