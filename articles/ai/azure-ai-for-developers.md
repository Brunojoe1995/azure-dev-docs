# Overview of AI app development

This documentation is designed for experienced developers who are new to building generative AI apps on Azure using Azure OpenAI Services and their favorite programming language.

## Introduction to generative AI for developers

Generative AI opens many new possibilities for applications. As a developer, it's important that you develop a mental model that maps how all the new terminology and technologies related to generative AI fit into what you already understand. The following series of articles show you how your current development experience applies to generative AI. 

* [Introduction to developing generative AI apps for experienced developers](./introduction-build-generative-ai-solutions.md)
* [Important concepts and considerations for developers building generative AI solutions](./gen-ai-concepts-considerations-developers.md)
* [Augmenting a Large Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Fine-tuning](./augment-llm-rag-fine-tuning.md)
* [Building advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems](./advanced-retrieval-augmented-generation.md)
