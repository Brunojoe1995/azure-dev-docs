# Overview of AI Apps

This area is designed for experienced developers new to building generative AI applications on Azure using Azure OpenAI Services and their favorite programming language.

If you're a developer just getting started with building AI Apps or adding AI features to your applications, the most important thing to keep in mind is that you can leverage your existing skills. You don't need to learn the complexities of training your own models, or invest in costly hardware before you can begin. You don't even need to learn a lot of new concepts. Instead, you do what you already know: you set up cloud services, write code to call APIs and perform business logic on the results, and possibly store data in databases. 

Even so, it might be helpful to understand _some_ [core concepts](./overview.md) to level-set as you get started.

Then, consider the overview page with links to popular articles, samples, documentation and more specific to your preferred programming language or platform ([.NET](./overview-dotnet.md), [Java](./overview-java.md), [Python](./overview-python.md), [JavaScript](./overview-javascript.md)).

Finally, when you're ready to jump in and start building something significant, we recommend you [get started with the enterprise chat sample using RAG](../python/get-started-app-chat-template.md).
