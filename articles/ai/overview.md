# Overview of AI Apps

This area is designed for experienced developers new to building generative AI applications on Azure using Azure OpenAI Services and their favorite programming language.

If you're a developer just getting started with building AI Apps or adding AI features to your applications, the most important thing to keep in mind is that you can leverage your existing skills.

## Concepts

It might be helpful to understand some core concepts to level-set as you get started.

|Link|Description|
|---|---|
|[Introduction to developing generative AI applications for experienced developers](./introduction-build-generative-ai-solutions.md)|Explores the developers role in integrating generative AI into applications, exploring its business benefits, operational fundamentals, and the potential of large language models (LLMs).|
|[Important concepts and considerations for developers building generative AI solutions](./gen-ai-concepts-considerations-developers.md)|Explains the limitations of LLMs and where LLMs get their information, how tokenization works and impacts results, and how to get the best results by modifying prompts, implementing an inference pipeline and tweaking optional API call parameters.|
|[Augmenting a Large Language Model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Fine-tuning](./augment-llm-rag-fine-tuning.md)|Details the two mechanisms that developers can use to augment the information LLMs use to compose their models: retrieval-augmented generation and fine-tuning.|
|[Building advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems](./advanced-retrieval-augmented-generation.md)|Discusses real-world considerations and patterns for RAG-based chat systems.|
